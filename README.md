Django Barebone User
---

⚠️ This project is no longer maintained! Use at your own risk.

This repository contains a single Django app that simplifies the default Django `User`. Django's `User` model has fields for username, password, email, first name, and last name. Django Barebone User container fields for just username and password. Django Barebone User is still compatible with all Django methods and functions.
